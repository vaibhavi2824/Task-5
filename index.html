                <h2>Story Number 1 </h2>
                <p> Hey, I am Olivia . I use the Maybelline Products and I like the coverage, skin tone, and quality of
                    the foundation concealer. </p>
                <p> It's nice, provides medium coverage and is perfect for my skin tone. The size, seal and quantity are
                    best. I recommend MAYBELLINE.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-item">
                <h2>Story Number 2</h2>
                <p>Helllo, Here's Ashley. I just loved MAYBELLINE brand. I feel that Maybelline New York compact Powder
                    is a game-changer! After trying numerous compact powders, I finally found my holy grail </p>
                <p>The breathable formula feels incredibly lightweight on my skin and is easily spreadable without
                    looking cakey.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Story Number 3</h2>
                <p>Helllo, Here's Ashley. I just loved MAYBELLINE brand. Maybelline New York Lash Sensational Sky High
                    Mascara is the greatest they've ever tried. </p>
                <p>I am enthused about how it quickly raises their lashes to new heights, removing the need for fake
                    eyelashes. The end product is beautiful lashes that enhance any cosmetic look and are quick to
                    apply.</p>
